# Auto ML

AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, is a project that focuses on streamlining the process of building machine learning models. <br>
The ability to automatically train, tune and deploy a model allows businesses to gain actionable insights from data and make better decisions faster. With the exponential growth of data, automating the process of building machine learning models has become an important area of research.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an accessible and easy-to-use AutoML application that provides a powerful tool for data scientists and businesses to create machine learning models without the need for extensive expertise in machine learning algorithms and techniques.

<hr>

## Features

- The application utilizes Python libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas, and TensorFlow to preprocess the data, select the best algorithms and tune their hyperparameters to create an optimal machine learning model.
- Additionally, the application uses Flask web framework to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the AutoML model.

## Future Enhancements

- Extensive Preprocessing techniques.
- Additional Customizations.
- Inclusion of Deep Learning
